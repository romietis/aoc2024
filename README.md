## Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge done in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Usage

This project uses Go multi-module [workspace](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces). In order to run the solutions, you need to `cd` into each day, because I don't use relative path to read the input files.

```bash
cd day01
go run .
```
